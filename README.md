This will be a portfolio website to showcase myself and my projects.
The idea is that it will be minimilaistic but it will also be a project to demonstrate my abilities in and of itself.
I will be hoping to have it loo similar to how a CLI or terminal would run where the user would need to input the page they want to go to instead of clicking.
It may end up being a bit obtuse in terms of usability but we'll see how it goes.
